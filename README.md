Problem Statement The goal is to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node on a grid, while avoiding obstacles. The grid is a 2D matrix where some cells are blocked, and these blocked cells are represented by * (obstacles), while free spaces (cells the robot or agent can move through) are represented by . (dots).

Grid Layout: S is the start node. G is the goal node.

represents an obstacle or a blocked cell that the agent cannot pass through. . represents an open space where the agent can move. The goal is to find the shortest, most efficient path from S to G, using the A* algorithm, while navigating around obstacles (*).
Example Grid: Here's an example of a 5x5 grid where some cells are blocked by obstacles:

S . . . . . * * . . . * . . . . * . * . . . . . G

Explanation of the Grid: S (Start node): The agent starts at position (0, 0). G (Goal node): The destination is at position (4, 4).

(Obstacle cells): These cells represent obstacles where the agent cannot move. In this grid, obstacles are placed at coordinates like (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3). . (Free space): These are the open cells where the agent can freely move, such as (0, 1), (2, 0), etc.
Problem: Given this grid, the goal is to determine the shortest path from S to G. The A* algorithm should be used, which combines two main aspects:

Actual cost (g): The cost to reach a specific cell from the start. Heuristic estimate (h): The estimated cost to reach the goal from the current cell (using an approximation, such as Manhattan distance). The A* algorithm combines these two to prioritize exploring the most promising paths first.

Constraints: Obstacles (*): The agent cannot pass through cells marked as *. These need to be avoided when calculating the path. Boundaries: The agent must stay within the grid bounds. Movement: The agent can only move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right).

A* Algorithm Steps: Initialize: Start by placing the start node S in the open list with a f value (total cost estimate). Explore: Select the node with the lowest f value from the open list (this node is the most promising). Check its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is a valid cell (not an obstacle *), calculate its new cost and check if it needs to be added to the open list. Goal Check: If the goal node G is reached, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the goal to the start using the came_from map. Repeat until the goal is found or all nodes are evaluated, in which case there's no valid path. Expected Output: The expected output of the algorithm is the shortest path from S to G, if one exists, represented by a list of coordinates.

Example Output: Given the above grid, the A* algorithm might find a path like this (depending on how the algorithm is implemented):

Path found: (0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 4) This shows the coordinates the agent should follow to get from S (start) to G (goal), avoiding obstacles along the way.

Conclusion: The problem is to use the A* algorithm to navigate through a grid with obstacles () and find the shortest path from the start (S) to the goal (G). The grid consists of free spaces (.), which the agent can traverse, while obstacles () block the agent's path. The A* algorithm efficiently finds the optimal path by considering both the actual movement cost and a heuristic estimate of the distance to the goal.
